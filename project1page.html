        <h1>Employee Management System</h1>
        <p>This project provides an Employee Management System with a graphical interface developed in Java and JavaFX.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This system manages employee records, offering functionalities to add, update, remove, and display information.
         It uses a linked list structure for managing employee data and ensures that records are efficiently accessible and modifiable
         through a GUI interface.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Core Components</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Node.java</h3>
        <p>Defines the <code>Node</code> class to represent an employee. Each node stores data attributes such as <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>address</code>, <code>salary</code>, <code>phone</code>, and <code>work hours</code>, along with a link to the next node.</p>

        <h3>2. LinkedList.java</h3>
        <p>Implements a singly linked list with methods for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Add</strong>: Insert an employee record at the front of the list.</li>
            <li><strong>Show</strong>: Display employee information by ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Update</strong>: Adjust employee salary based on their work hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove</strong>: Delete an employee record by ID.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. HelloController.java</h3>
        <p>Acts as the controller to connect the GUI with the linked list functionalities. It handles user actions such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Add Employee</strong>: Adds a new employee based on user input.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Salary</strong>: Updates an employee's salary if the work hours meet specified requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove Employee</strong>: Removes an employee by their ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Show Employee</strong>: Displays details of a selected employee.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. hello-view.fxml</h3>
        <p>This file structures the graphical user interface layout using JavaFX. It provides input fields, buttons, and tabs for different functionalities (e.g., Add, Update, Show).</p>

        <h3>5. HelloApplication.java</h3>
        <p>The main application file that launches the JavaFX application and sets up the primary window with a specified title and dimensions.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>User-friendly GUI developed with JavaFX.</li>
            <li>Efficient linked list structure to manage employee data.</li>
            <li>Validation of inputs for error handling and data integrity.</li>
            <li>Easy-to-navigate tabs for adding, updating, removing, and displaying employee details.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Upon launching the application, users can interact with the system through a series of tabs, each serving a specific function (e.g., adding a record, updating salary, etc.). The linked list data structure ensures that each employeeâ€™s record is uniquely stored and accessible by ID, and the system provides appropriate messages and alerts to guide the user.</p>
